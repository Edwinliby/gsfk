                <h1>Why Amuseum Science Expo</h1>
                <p>
                    There is something in this world that has touched the lives of everyone and has forever
                    changed their lives. It has shaped humanity and fundamentally affected how we interact with the world around us.
                    For something that has given so much to the world, <b>Science is often forgotten</b>.
                    <br /><br />
                    We at Amuseum Science Expo seek to change that by highlighting the strengths, beauty and limitations of Science.
